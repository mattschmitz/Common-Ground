# Common Ground

 Want to meet up with friends after work, but can't find a good spot that's easy for everyone to get to? Common Ground locates optimal meeting places based on travel times. Simply enter your starting locations and a desired type of meeting place - for example 'bars' or 'german restaurants'. You can even select different travel modes for each person - walk, bike, drive or transit.
